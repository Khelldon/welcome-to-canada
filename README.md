**Story**: In the early days of the outbreak, the virus spread very fast across the majority of the world. 
It was quickly discovered that the virus had a weakness to cold temperatures. Soon the cold regions of 
the world were the only places left uninfected. While all northern countries closed their borders, instituting
a "every man for himself" policy, Canada on the other hand opened the borders to anyone who could make it there.
Within a few weeks the population of Canada's northern cities and settlements were overstaurated with a vastly diverse
population. For a while everything was fine, with many army bases set up across the country and all nationalities working 
together, it seemed there was hope... Then the virus mutated with an immunity to cold weather. While still drawn to heat the
infected no longer die in cold temperatures like they once did. The infection has taken the world. 

In a last ditch attempt to save the human race, many of the worlds scientists taking assylum in Canada spent every waking moment
attempting to cure the virus any way they could. As times drew darker the scientists started to grow desparate. Many mistakes were made.
The first giant mistake was releasing an experimental air borne vaccine that ended up poluting the atmosphere and creating a red mist 
that aggrivated the undead to no end and hightened their senses, now once a week we pass through another cloud. This was terrible,
but even worse was the "frankenstein" like experimentation that occured and perhaps still may be occuring across Canada. Where once 
there was only undead to deal with, now there are real monsters out there. 

Now you are one of the last people alive on earth, with a strong immunity to the virus, you are left to survive the cold while fending
off thousands of starving Zombies. Completely trapped inside a radiated zone, there is no escape, you must survive here.

**About**: This is a complete conversion for 7 days to Die a17 x.x.x. Most of it is written using xpath, a full conversion in modlet formatting.
In addition to being a code based mod, the mod also comes with it's own map. Just as the game comes with Navezgane you will also find the map "Canada"
in your list now. It is HIGHLY recommended that you play the game using the Canada map. A lot of time and attention to detail will be found in the Canada
map that you will never get in a random gen world. Random gen is quite functional but will lack the praplanned scenes, events, loot, doo-hickies and cool stuff you'll find
in the Canada map.
